# Symmetric Cipher Tool üîê  

A Django-powered web application that provides a suite of symmetric encryption and decryption tools. Supports classical ciphers like Caesar, Vigen√®re, Playfair, Single Columnar, and Double Columnar, as well as the modern AES cipher.

## Features  
- User-friendly interface for encryption and decryption.  
- Support for both classical and modern symmetric ciphers.  
- Light/Dark mode toggle for better accessibility.  

## Getting Started  

Follow these steps to set up the Symmetric Cipher Tool on your local machine.  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- pip (Python package installer)  
- Git  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/celsopuerto/Symmetric-Cipher.git
   cd symmetric-cipher-tool

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
3. Activate the virtual environment:
  On Windows:
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
